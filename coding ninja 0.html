Best Coding &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Practices for Hassle-free ProgrammingJust like with any other activity, the world of coding is also 
governed by informal rules. Most of these rules are formulated over decades. Programming languages often remain in usage 
for longer than their founders expectogrammers find innovative ways to recreate these languages for different
 purposes. Thus, some static doâ€™s and donâ€™ts are always of use in the fluid zone called coding. Normally, a great code 
has three common features: maintainability, dependability, and usability. It should also be adaptable enough to be efficient even 
in changing environments. However, before coding even begins, a few prerequisites need to be fulfilled in order to provide a solid 
foundation on which readable code can be written.
